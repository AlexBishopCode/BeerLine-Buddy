<hr>

### Fonts

Fonts were imported into the code from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- The main logo uses the font 'Fredoka'. This font was chosen for the logo after some research into font stylings that draw inspiration from the 1960s - an era heavily associated with Soho and Carnaby Street.
- The logo is a big, round and friendly font that is also bold and simple in design. This choice of font means the the logo always stands out, creating contrast against the simplistic styling of the secondary font.
- It seemed appropriate to use this font as it can immiediately be associated with the history of the area which in turn is immediately relevant due to the historical themes explored within the walking tours.
- The secondary font is 'Roboto', a sens-serif font. The font is simple and creates a frictionless reading experiene. The simplicity of the font creates a nice contrast to the 'Fredoka' logo font and ensures all information on the web page is clear and easy to read. A mixture of bold, italic and light variants of the 'Roboto' font have been used to create contrast between headers and paragraphs.

<hr>

### Icons

- Icons from the 'Fontawesome' Icon library have been utilised as classes within i tags.
- The icons have been styled cohesively with the overarching color palette.
- Icons present within the accesssibility section of the web page are displayed in a blue (#2E2999) color as this color is believed to encourage a perception of trust.
- Social media icons have been positioned within the web page footer. By utilising the 'a' tag these icons have associated hyperlinks. Now the user can identify the speicifc social media platform based on each platforms iconic logo and access the hyperlink immediately with one click.

### Colors

With the user and business goals in mind, it is important for this site to have a minimalist color palette. The color palette needs to appear professional and needs to constrast where appropriate to make the content clear and easy-to-read whilst also ensuring that the page has character.

- 'Dun' #DCD0B6 - This gentle color is used the provide character and as a background to distinguish between sections of the web page. The color mirrors the building walls on the hero image and ensures the page feels familiar for the full length of the web page. The color along-side the hero image is intended to evoke imagery of an urban area such as Soho.

- 'Whitesmoke' #F5F5F5 - A comfortbale off-white. This color provides a perfect canvas for bold easy-to-read text on large sections of the website whilst also providing more character than a stark bright white.

- 'Jet #323232 - A dusty shade of black. This color has been used to add an element of sophistication to the font color on the website. This variation of black suggests age and mystery, reflecting the nature of the walking tours. This color is chosen for our font-styles to stand out on a pale background.

- 'International Klein Blue' #2E2999 - A deep blue which is sure to stand out against a pale background color. The blue has been used for icons, as a hover animation stylings and for some text to amphasise certain sections of the site.
This color is said to suggest responsibility amd trust and is utilised to make the user feel at ease when using this service.

### Images

A full-quality hero image (displayed below) is utilised at the top of the page so the user immediatley understands that the service provided operates in Soho. The hero image is taken on a day with blue skies to appear friendly and welcoming to the user which helps to influence user engagement.

The three images (displayed below) utilised within the tours section were chosen due to their association with each of the themed walks. This is to provide the user with a small glimpse into the kinds of things they will encounter on each specific tour.

### FEATURES

<hr>

#### Page Elements

<hr>

##### Hero Image

A large hero image spans the full width of the page and is the first image the user sees upon entering the site. The large image is designed to immediatley grab the users attention as they land on the site. 

The hero image uses responsive stlying to ensure all screen sizes can faciltiate the image and keep the page elements visually proportionate to the page width.

![Hero image screenshot on a desktop](assets/documents/readme-images/readme-hero-img.png)

<hr>

##### Nav Bar

The navigation bar contains a promient logo and is responsive so that on larger screens it displays all the page menu links in a row and on smaller screens the manu links are contained within a drop down menu after clicking a burger icon.

The menu options on the nav bar have animated CSS styling so that they appear blue when you hover over the text, drawing attention to the options as you select.

The position of the navigation bar is sticky so that when users scroll down the page the menu navigation bar remains at the top of the page. This feature allows the user to access the menu items quickly and at all times, saving time and providing a more positive user experience.

A box shadow has been added to the navigation bar and the drop down menu to ensure the menu bar remains prominent and stands out on the page.

<hr>

#### Info Bar

The info bar is located immediately below the navigation bar. The info bar is immediatley visible as the user lands on the web page.

The icons and text on this ribbon section provide clear and impactful information which immedialtely informs the user what services are provided. 

The icons are easily recongisable to all users, are visually striking and make the services and purpose of the company more understandable.

The info bar has been constructed within a grid where the icons and their associated text appear in two columns on smaller screens, and within a row on larger screens. This styling ensures the website remains visually proportionate.

Users tend to read from left to right, an icon of a walking person with text saying 'walking tours' has been positioned on the left of the info bar. This is so that users immediately distinguish the main service the business is offering. This leaves less room for ambiguity created by the somewhat ambiguous brand name.

<hr>

#### Tours Info Section

The tours section includes information regarding the three tours that are currently available to the user.

Three sections of informative text have been presented on top of three separate images. Each image is related to its respective text.

Images have been used here to communicate the purpose of each tour and to help the user distinguish between the tours, giving a sense of variety.

Each of the three tours have been styled into a flexbox grid. The flex value allows for a media query to be utilised and to position the content side by side in three columns on larger screens and stacked on top of one another on smaller screens.

The width of the images within the content are all fully resonsive to adjustments in screen size.

<hr>

#### Accessibility Info Section

The accessibility information section includes four divs within a flexbox grid. Each div contains clear information and icons to provide users wishing to learn more about the accessibility of the tours with more information. 

The flexbox grid allows the information to be responsive to changes in screen size and the content changes column formation via a screen size media query.

![Accessibility section on a desktop](assets/documents/readme-images/readme-accessibility.png)

<hr>

#### Sign Up Section

The sign up section is created using a form element. The form is designed to be simple and easy to use.

Positioning the form at the bottom of the site ensures the user flow is not interrupted. When the user flow is interrupted it can encourage user abandoment. 

The simple design is purposeful to ensure that the process of completing the form appears easy and streamlined.

An option for the user to sign up for a newsletter has been added using radiobuttons at the bottom of the form to allow them to give permission for further information and promotional material to be sent to their email.

![HTML validator result screenshot on desktop](assets/documents/readme-images/readme-html-val.png)

![Lighthouse validator result screenshot on desktop](assets/documents/readme-images/readme-lighthouse-val.png)


##### MOBILE TESTING
- The site was frequently tested on my personal iphone with iOS as well as sent to friends/family with samsungs and older models of iphones to ask for feedback.
- Testing involved going through the entire sign up process, utilising the navigation bar, and checking all website functions.
- Chrome was utilised to inspect the site in mobile and tablet format, navigating the pages and testing the functions within Chromes 'development tools' service.

##### Desktop Testing
- The site has been developed within Chrome on a Macbook Pro.
- The site was sent to friends and family with instructions to open the page on their desktops.
- The site has been tested on multiple browsers including Safari.

#### BUGS

##### Existing Bugs
- The hero image does not fully cover the hero div within a narrow screensize specifity on some specific screen sizes when tested. 

##### Fixed Bugs
- The fixed (sticky) navigation bar at the top of the page was covering sections of text when utilised so the associated sections of the site you were expecting to navigate to appeared muddled and unclear. This was fixed by adding a hidden div above each section the same height of the nav bar and linking each nav bar menu option to the appropriate hidden divs in order for the user to see the full content of the section they choose to view.

- The booking form loaded an error message once details had been entered saying the page visited was not secure. This was due to a typo in the target="" where https:// was written as http://.

- Accessibility performance initially failed in testing due to a lack of contrast between a previous blue utilised for font-color on the site. After changing blue to a darker shade the accessibility rating checked provided a successful score of 100.

##### DEPLOYMENT

This site has been deployed to GitHub pages via the following steps:

- Within the GitHub 60-Minute-Soho repository, the settings tab was opened.
